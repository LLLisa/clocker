After running `npm install`, run `npm run init` and it will create a file in the root dir called 'secrets.js'. Go into this file and input your username and password in the appropriate spots.

Puppeteer uses a local cache to ensure that every time you open a new instance, you are using the same browser with the same cookies and local storage. If you ever need to reset this, just delete the 'localCache' directory and it will be re-generated the next time you run the program.
